The idea by Boyan Slat, a Dutch student to clean up the oceans using movable boundaries in the ocean that can be manuevered after deploymentseems promising to clean up the great Pacific plastic dump. This deployable rails
 can be fitted with sensors to detect current of water their direction and strength and any changes in their direction. This data can be used to collaborate with the satellite imagery data of winds and 
 be better aware of conditions on the sea level. The mobile nature of this deployment means that it can be moved as needed to track the changes of interest.
